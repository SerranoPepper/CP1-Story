Today I woke up super tired
I didn't eat breakfast because I was running a little late
I got to school on time though
In period 1
In period 2
In periods 3-6 I had a pretty easy day due to a band rehersal
We played really good and went crazy
Editors note: In our band concert we sounded the best out of all other bands and its our first year :D
We sound great for our concert tonight
My 7th period was an easier class then normal
I finished my project super early
In 8th we started this project
I got home and got my siblings from bus
Today I added one more edit to make it five :)
