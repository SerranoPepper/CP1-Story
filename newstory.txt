Today I woke up super tired
I didn't eat breakfast because I was running a little late
I got to school on time though
I had a pretty easy day due to a band rehersal
We played really good and went crazy
We sound great for our concert tonight
My 7th period was an easier class then normal
I finished my project super early
In 8th we started this project
